My final project for my Space Mechanics class was to conduct an asteroid retrieval mission. We were told a spacecraft would depart from Earth on a trip to an asteroid to capture a boulder from the asteroid and return it to an orbit around the Moon. It was required to design the trajectory of the spacecraft from Earth departure until the final orbit around the Moon. The assumptions given consisted of the following:
** Spacecraft has a 6 Ton dry mass


Near Earth objects (NEO) have become increasingly desirable  locations to navigate over recent decades because  of the insight asteroids give to the earlier formation of our solar system and beginning of life on Earth. Team 5 has been contracted to manifest the trajectories of one of these missions to retrieve samples from a NEO asteroid. To keep fuel mass as low as possible, a lunar fly-by will be performed before rendezvousing with the asteroid. After rendezvousing with the asteroid for several days, the spacecraft has been instructed to return to Earth and perform capture maneuvers to arrive at an orbit around the Moon. The timeline has been set to start the mission between January 2018 and December 2018 and should not exceed 6 years.

My senior design involved building a sensor system for our Aerospace Enterprise's Class ISO 8 clean room. The Aerospace Enterprise is a student organization at Michigan Tech University and member of MTU's Enterprise Program.




#### What is the MTU Aerospace Enterprise?
The Enterprise is composed of a diverse multidisciplinary group of over 50 students. Students work together on innovative and relevant Aerospace related projects, and all members contribute towards achieving specific project goals. Through the Aerospace Enterprise students are able to enhance their engineering and Aerospace knowledge, as well as develop personal and leadership skills that will provide valuable work experience before graduation. Additionally, students work closely with industry sponsors whose contributions play a vital role to the Enterprise's success.

I was involved in both the structures and ground support equipment teams. During my time on structures, I helped design the components of the satellites by using Solidworks and Siemens NX. Additionally, we performed FEA analyses to ensure our design could withstand extreme environments. I learned to design with manufacturability and

#### What is a Clean Room? Why is it an important?
The Aerospace Enterprise has a Class ISO 8 clean room, meaning that according to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14644-1, the air can contain <i>at most</i> 3,520,000 particles per cubic meter.

The lower the class, the stricter the particle count becomes. Without any sort of sensor system, our organization had no way of actually proving that we were meeting

    <h3> Aerospace Clean Room Recertification </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> <i> Circuit board fabrication, IoT platform integration, </i> </li>
    </ul>
    <p> A clean room's goal is to reduce particulate contamination by controlling environmental parameters such as humidity, temperature and pressure. If excess debris ends up in a clean room where critical flight hardware is present, satellite equipment can be damaged leading to extended timelines and loss of money. In order to confirm Michigan Tech's Aerospace Enterprise's clean room met Class ISO 8 standards, I designed a continually monitoring sensor system. This involved tasks such as creating circuit boards and system integration maps. </p>

    <h3> Asteroid Retrieval Mission </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> <i> MatLab, </i> </li>
    </ul>
    <p> In order to conduct research on early solar system life, my project group was tasked to calculate a rendezvous mission to a local asteroid within a 2-year timeline. We were told to incoporate a lunar fly-by and to also end our mission in lunar orbit after the rendezvous. </p>

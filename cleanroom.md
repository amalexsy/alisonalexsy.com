## HELLO!

## My senior design involved building a sensor system for our Aerospace Enterprise's Class ISO 8 clean room. The Aerospace Enterprise is a student organization at Michigan Tech University and member of MTU's Enterprise Program. The Enterprise is composed of a diverse multidisciplinary group of over 50 students. Students work together on innovative and relevant Aerospace related projects, and all members contribute towards achieving specific project goals. Through the Aerospace Enterprise students are able to enhance their engineering and Aerospace knowledge, as well as develop personal and leadership skills that will provide valuable work experience before graduation. Additionally, students work closely with industry sponsors whose contributions play a vital role to the Enterprise's success.

Hello! you have stumbled across my personal website repo, thanks for stopping in!

---

This site is created with jekyll, with a heavly modified version of the particle jekyll theme.

To deploy this to my webserver travis-ci is used to build the site and scp it up to the host.

If the badge up there is failing, please contact me at webmaster@alisonalexsy.com

If you would like to use my modified theme you are more than welcome to just copy the files to your own instance of jekyll and modify the html and markdown for your content!
